Design a finite state machine (FSM) with at least 9 states. You decide the inputs and outputs. There must be inputs and outputs (Cannot just transition automatically every clock cycle). Draw the state diagram of your FSM.
Model A: model your FSM with SV using the regular case statements with binary state coding. 
Model B: model your FSM with SV using the regular case statements with one-hot state coding. 
Model C: model your FSM with SV using the reversed case statements with one-hot state coding.
